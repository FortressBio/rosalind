Rosalind (http://rosalind.info/) presents a series of increasingly complex bioinformatics problems. Each one provides a short biological background, an accompanying computational problem, and a data set. The data set is used as input to the user's code and the resulting answer fed to Rosalind to be evaluated automatically. In this repository I'll be posting my solutions, in either Python or R, as I work through the catalog.
